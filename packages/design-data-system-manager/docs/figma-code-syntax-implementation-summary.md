# Figma Code Syntax Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Figma code syntax pre-processing plan, ensuring that code syntax data is properly passed through the transformer according to the project rules and architectural principles.

## Problem Solved

The original issue was that **code syntax data was missing from transformed data for Figma Export**. This was caused by:

1. **Architectural Mismatch**: The transformer was generating its own Figma variable names instead of using pre-generated code syntax
2. **Inconsistent Data Flow**: Code syntax generation was happening in multiple places with different logic
3. **Schema Violation**: Previous approaches incorrectly assumed `codeSyntax` should be stored in schema

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Pure Transformer Architecture

Following the pre-processing plan, the `FigmaTransformer` is now a **pure function** that:
- Receives pre-processed data with dynamically generated code syntax
- Extracts and uses the pre-generated code syntax for variable names and code syntax properties
- Has no external dependencies or side effects

### 2. Preprocessor-Based Code Syntax Generation

The `FigmaPreprocessor` handles all code syntax generation:
- **Dynamic Generation**: Code syntax is generated on-demand, not stored in schema
- **Platform Mapping**: Uses `figmaPlatformMapping` to map user platforms to Figma platforms (WEB, iOS, ANDROID)
- **Syntax Patterns**: Leverages existing `PlatformSyntaxPatternService` for platform-specific syntax patterns
- **Taxonomy Ordering**: Respects `taxonomyOrder` for consistent naming

### 3. Updated Data Flow

```
Token Data (no codeSyntax)
    ↓
FigmaPreprocessor (generates code syntax dynamically)
    ↓
Enhanced Token Data (with codeSyntax property)
    ↓
FigmaTransformer (extracts and uses pre-generated code syntax)
    ↓
Figma API Format (with proper code syntax)
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. FigmaTransformer Updates (`packages/data-transformations/src/transformers/figma.ts`)

**Removed:**
- `generateFigmaVariableName()` method (was generating its own names)
- `getTokenSystemFromContext()` method (unused)

**Added:**
- `getFigmaCodeSyntax()` method to extract appropriate code syntax from pre-generated data
- Updated `transformTokensWithDaisyChaining()` to use pre-generated code syntax
- Updated `createSimpleVariables()` to use pre-generated code syntax

**Key Logic:**
```typescript
// Extract pre-generated code syntax
const codeSyntax = this.buildCodeSyntax(token, tokenSystem);
const figmaCodeSyntax = this.getFigmaCodeSyntax(token, codeSyntax, tokenSystem);

// Use for variable creation
const variable = this.createSimpleVariable(token, tokenSystem, figmaCodeSyntax);
```

### 2. FigmaPreprocessor Implementation (`packages/design-data-system-manager/src/services/figmaPreprocessor.ts`)

**Features:**
- Generates code syntax for all platforms with `figmaPlatformMapping`
- Uses existing `PlatformSyntaxPatternService` for syntax patterns
- Respects taxonomy ordering for consistent naming
- Provides comprehensive validation and error handling

**Code Syntax Generation:**
```typescript
// Generate code syntax for each token dynamically
const enhancedTokens = tokenSystem.tokens?.map(token => {
  const codeSyntax: Record<string, string> = {};
  
  for (const platform of targetPlatforms) {
    const platformPatterns = syntaxPatterns[platform.id];
    if (platformPatterns && platform.figmaPlatformMapping) {
      const formattedName = this.generateFormattedName(token, platformPatterns, tokenSystem);
      codeSyntax[platform.figmaPlatformMapping] = formattedName;
    }
  }
  
  return {
    ...token,
    codeSyntax: Object.keys(codeSyntax).length > 0 ? codeSyntax : undefined
  };
}) || [];
```

### 3. FigmaExportService Integration (`packages/design-data-system-manager/src/services/figmaExport.ts`)

**Updated Flow:**
```typescript
// 1. Get merged data using existing infrastructure
const mergedData = StorageService.getMergedData();

// 2. Pre-process with code syntax generation
const preprocessorResult = await this.preprocessor.preprocessForFigma({
  includePlatformCodeSyntax: true
});

// 3. Transform pre-processed data
const result = await this.transformer.transform(preprocessorResult.enhancedTokenSystem, transformerOptions);
```

## Validation Results

The implementation has been validated with a comprehensive test that confirms:

✅ **Preprocessor generates code syntax**: Code syntax is dynamically generated for all platforms with Figma mapping  
✅ **Transformer extracts code syntax**: The transformer properly extracts and uses pre-generated code syntax  
✅ **Figma variable gets code syntax**: Variables are created with proper code syntax properties  
✅ **Code syntax matches platform mapping**: Platform mappings (WEB, iOS, ANDROID) are respected  

## Example Output

For a token with:
- Display name: "Primary Blue"
- Taxonomies: Color → Primary, Hue → Blue
- Platforms: Web (WEB mapping), iOS (iOS mapping)

**Generated Code Syntax:**
```json
{
  "WEB": "--spprimary-blue",
  "iOS": "spPrimary_Blue"
}
```

**Figma Variable:**
```json
{
  "name": "--spprimary-blue",
  "codeSyntax": {
    "WEB": "--spprimary-blue",
    "iOS": "spPrimary_Blue"
  }
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Schema Compliance**

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully resolves the missing code syntax issue by:

1. **Following the pre-processing plan** to create a pure transformer architecture
2. **Leveraging existing infrastructure** for data management and syntax patterns
3. **Ensuring schema compliance** by not storing code syntax in the schema
4. **Providing platform flexibility** through proper mapping and syntax pattern support

The code syntax data is now properly passed through the transformer, ensuring that Figma variables are created with the correct code syntax for all mapped platforms (WEB, iOS, ANDROID).
