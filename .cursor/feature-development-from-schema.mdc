summary: New features and UI organization must be driven by insights from [schema.json](mdc:token-model/packages/data-model/src/schema.json).
details:
- Use [schema.json](mdc:token-model/packages/data-model/src/schema.json) to identify opportunities for new features and UI organization.
- Favor modularity and reusability by searching for existing components before building new ones.
- Only build custom components when necessary.
